Moving Rainbow
==============

Learn Computer Science the fun way!

Moving Rainbow is a set of labs to teach us the concepts of Computer Science using some fun electronics components.  We focus on the use of Arduinos and addressable LED strips to create fun projects.

Being able to control the world around us creates a wonderful feeling of empowerment.  We are no longer limited to what our cellphone can do.  We can program lights and motors around to obey our every command.  The Moving Rainbow kits will be your guide.  You will start out with a simple blink lab but quickly move to exotic colors, patterns and motion.  We can even hook up sensors to change the LEDs based on what is happening in the world around us.

Moving Rainbow Addressable LED Kits
----------

Although this guide is designed to work with a simple kit of parts you can purchase on-line for about $13, it can be used by anyone that has an Arduino and a addressable LED strip. 

Once you have become familiar with the Arduino and the LED kit you can then try your hand at using the CoderDojo Robot Kits.
