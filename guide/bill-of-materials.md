Moving Rainbow Bill of Materials
==============

We encourage everyone to purchase one device from (or make a donation to) the fine people at [Arduino.org](http://arduino.org) and [Arudino.cc](Arduino.cc).  It is their efforts that have produced the popular tools that we use to program our chips.

We also want to thank the people at Adafruit for writing the NeoPixel driver libraries.

Here are some of the parts you can purchase on-line:
